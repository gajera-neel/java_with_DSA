# Time complexity cases  
Best Case:  
This represents the most favorable input scenario for the algorithm, resulting in the fastest possible execution time. The best-case time  complexity is often denoted using the omega notation (Ω).     

Average Case:   
This scenario reflects the typical performance of the algorithm across a variety of inputs. The average-case time complexity is typically represented using the theta notation (Θ).     

Worst Case:  
This represents the least favorable input scenario, where the algorithm takes the longest time to execute. The worst-case time complexity is usually analyzed using the big O notation (O).
